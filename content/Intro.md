## Introduction {#Home}

This book is intented for new economics students wanting to find out
how to write economic model with heterogenous agents, and to solve
them on a computer. 

A similar but extremely accomplished book is [Quantitative Economics](http://quant-econ.net/index.html) by  John Stachurski and Thomas J. Sargent. Their book uses the `python` language which we also really like. We hope that the notes we present here can complement the content of their book with applications focused on the use of `R/C++`.

There are several other excellent books on using `R`, we particularly like the following ones:

 - [ggplot2](http://www.amazon.co.uk/ggplot2-Elegant-Graphics-Data-Analysis/dp/0387981403) to generate publication quality graphics.
 - [R/C++ programing](http://adv-r.had.co.nz/) by Hadley Wickham is a non econ-centric introduction to `R` and `C++`
 - [Applied Econometrics with R](http://www.amazon.co.uk/Applied-Econometrics-R-Use/dp/0387773169) is an excellent book on how to replace your old stata with state of the art R!

Thank you, tibo & flo.
